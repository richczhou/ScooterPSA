# Scooter PSA

---

A satirical take on the visual clutter of Spin scooters improperly parked all over college campuses. Made for 51-372 Design Persuasion.

A huge thank you to [Niilo Poutanen](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tier-scooter-9479a6d3f1474971afde26b33fe96c55) for the scooter model and [Paul Henschel](https://codesandbox.io/s/object-clump-ssbdsw) for the inspiration and being a wonderful human being.
